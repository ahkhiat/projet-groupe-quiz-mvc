# ScienceQuiz Application
Initialized on 2024 March, the 27th

## Description

This application is aimed at all online game lovers and science enthusiasts. Users will be able to choose between two different modules: the Human Body or Space. Each module will consist of three levels: beginner, intermediate, and advanced.

Each level will contain a minimum of 50 questions, from which 10 questions will be randomly selected for a game. Ideally, we should aim for a database of 200 questions per level, with 50 questions being selected for the game.

The time limit will be a maximum of 15 seconds per question. Each correct answer will increase the score, and incorrect answers will have no impact (a life system can be implemented as an optional feature).

## Game Flow:

The question is displayed with a choice of 4 possible answers, only one of which is correct.
The time limit per question will be a maximum of 15 seconds. The user can answer the question and click the “next” button or wait for the end of the 15 seconds.
After 15 seconds, whether an answer has been selected or not, the game moves on to the next question.

## Admin

The administrator will be able to determine the number of questions asked in a quiz, as well as the time allotted for each question.
They can add themes, modules, and questions, as well as delete them.
